# Welcome to Specmatic

[Specmatic](https://specmatic.io) is an open-source tool that brings **contract-driven development** to your software delivery pipeline. It enables teams to build, test, and integrate microservices with confidence using **contracts-as-tests**, based on the OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

We help developers shift API testing left, remove dependencies on downstream systems, and enable faster, more reliable CI/CD pipelines.

## 🔧 What Does Specmatic Do?

- **Contract Testing**: Validates if services adhere to their OpenAPI contracts.
- **Service Virtualization**: Mocks downstream services to enable independent testing.
- **Dynamic Test Generation**: Generates test cases from OpenAPI contracts.
- **Kafka Contract Testing**: Supports testing of event-driven systems with Kafka.
